### Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Build and watch for changes
- `npm run build` - Build the extension for production
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

### How It Works

1. **List Parsing**: The extension parses your free-form grocery list into structured items with names, quantities, units, and notes
2. **Background Coordination**: A service worker manages the shopping state and coordinates between the popup and content script
3. **Content Script**: Injected into HEB.com pages, it performs the actual automation:
   - Searches for each item
   - Finds product cards on search results
   - Clicks "Add to Cart" buttons
4. **Real-time Updates**: Progress is communicated back to the popup for live status display

## List Format

The parser is flexible and supports multiple formats:

### Section Headers
```
[Produce]
[Dairy]
[Canned Goods & Soups]
```

### Quantities and Units
```
1 cup Milk
2 lbs Chicken
1/2 cup Butter
1 1/2 cups Sugar
```

Supported units: cup, tsp, tbsp, oz, lb, g, kg, bag, can, pkg, bottle, count

### Bullets and Numbering
```
- Eggs
* Bread
‚Ä¢ Cheese
1. Milk
2. Butter
```

### Notes
```
1 large Sweet Onion (finely chopped)
Chicken (rotisserie)
```

## Limitations

- **Product selection**: The extension currently selects the first available search result. You may need to adjust items in your cart.
- **Bot detection**: HEB.com may occasionally challenge automated sessions. The extension works directly in your browser, so it's less likely to be blocked than headless automation.
- **Manual setup required**: You must be signed in and have your store/preferences set before running the extension.
- **Error handling**: Unexpected modals (age verification, substitutions) may cause the automation to fail. Check the logs and manually intervene if needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Extension doesn't load:**
- Make sure you built the extension (`npm run build`)
- Check that you're loading the `extension/dist` folder, not the `extension` folder
- Ensure icons are present in `extension/dist/icons/`

**Shopping doesn't start:**
- Make sure you're on HEB.com when you click "Start Shopping"
- Check that you're signed in to your HEB account
- Look at the logs in the popup for error messages

**Items aren't being added:**
- HEB.com's page structure may have changed
- Check the browser console (F12) for errors
- The extension may need updates to match new selectors

**Extension is too fast/slow:**
- Adjust the delay values in `content-script.ts` if needed
- The default includes small delays between items to avoid overwhelming the site

## Privacy & Terms

- This extension operates entirely in your browser and doesn't send data to any external servers
- All shopping is performed using your own HEB.com session
- Use this extension responsibly and in accordance with HEB's Terms of Service
- The extension is provided as-is with no warranties
